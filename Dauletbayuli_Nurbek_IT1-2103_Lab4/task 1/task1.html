        <td>The culture of the <a class="a_cult" href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Культура_США">United States of America</a> was shaped by the ethnic and racial diversity of the country. It was significantly influenced by immigrants from countries such as Ireland, Germany, Italy, Poland, descendants of slaves brought from Africa, as well as American Indians and native Hawaiians. Nevertheless, a decisive contribution was made by the culture of immigrants from England, which spread the English language, the legal system and other cultural achievements.

American cinema, television, blues, jazz, rap and rock serve as the foundation of world mass culture. It was in the USA that the Internet, the mass car first appeared, information technologies were developed and, being one of the leading economic and military powers of the world, it largely determines the lifestyle of the rest of humanity.</td>

        <td><a class="a_cult" href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Культура_Японии">The culture of Japan </a>was formed as a result of a historical process that began with the relocation of the ancestors of the Japanese people to the Japanese archipelago from the mainland and the emergence of the culture of the Dzemon period. Modern Japanese culture has been strongly influenced by Asian countries (especially China and Korea), Europe and North America, which has rapidly begun to influence Japanese culture since the early 1960s[1]. One of the features of Japanese culture is its long development during the period of complete isolation of the country (Sakoku policy) from the rest of the world during the reign of the Tokugawa shogunate, which lasted until the middle of the XIX century — the beginning of the Meiji period.

The culture and mentality of the Japanese were greatly influenced by the isolated territorial position of the country, geographical and climatic features, as well as special natural phenomena (frequent earthquakes and typhoons), which was expressed in the peculiar attitude of the Japanese to nature as a living creature. The ability to admire the momentary beauty of nature as a feature</td>

The artistic monuments of the region demonstrate a remarkable combination of influences that illustrate the multicultural nature of Central Asian society. The transfer of art along the Silk Road, Scythian art, Greco-Buddhist art, Serindia art, and more recently Persian culture are all part of this complex history.

The special identity of African-American culture is rooted in the historical experience of the African-American people, including the Middle Passage. Culture is different and has a huge impact on American and world culture in general.[1][2][3]

African-American culture is rooted in a mixture of indigenous African cultures of West and Central Africa and European culture, which influenced and modified its development in the American South. Understanding one's identity in the culture of the United States, that is, in an anthropological sense, realizing one's origin as largely a mixture of West and Central African cultures. Although slavery severely limited the ability of Africans to follow their ancestral cultural traditions, many customs, values and beliefs have been preserved and over time modified and/or mixed with European</td>
